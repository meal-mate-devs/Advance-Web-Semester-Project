This repository implements a web application called "Meal Mate", which serves as a personal recipe collection and management platform. 
The application allows users to browse, generate, and manage recipes, as well as organize them into structured courses. It is built 
primarily with JavaScript, using React for the front-end and Node.js/Express for the backend.

Key Features:
- Recipe Generation: Users can describe a desired recipe (e.g., "a spicy Asian-inspired lunch"), and the system generates suitable recipes with ingredients and instructions.
- Course Management: Chefs (special users) can create, upload, and manage cooking courses, each with a title, description, cover image, and a set of linked recipes.
- User Authentication: Access to certain features (like uploading courses) is restricted to authenticated users with the proper role.
- Recipe Browsing: Users can browse available courses and recipes, view details, and see the chef's profile and specialties.
- Modern UI: Built with React + Vite, using modern UI libraries and best practices.

The platform covers:
- Recipe creation (manual or generated)
- Course management (grouping recipes into courses)
- User authentication and role-based features (e.g., only chefs can upload courses)
- Recipe and course browsing with detailed pages
